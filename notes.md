- How is life handled in reward function?



- State
  - Is a ghost targeting same node as pacman
  - State of nearby nodes
  - State of nodes outside that range
  - Don't care about pacman position - care about position of everything else relative to pacman
- What to do about portals?
  - We cannot consider it just as a left option
  - Just have it as a 5th action option
